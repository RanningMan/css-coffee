The `all` CSS property resets all of the selected elementâ€™s properties, except the `direction` and `unicode-bidi` properties that control text direction. It is most useful when all styles of a component need to be reset.

Values:  
`initial`: Specifies that all the element's properties should be changed to their initial values.  
`inherit`: Specifies that all the element's properties should be changed to their inherited values.  
`unset`: Specifies that all the element's properties should be changed to their inherited values if they inherit by default, or to their initial values if not.
