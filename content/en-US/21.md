The animation-timing-function CSS property sets how an animation progresses through the duration of each cycle.  
There are multiple values can be applied to this property, we will look at the default value: ease.  
A value of ease equals to cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0), which increases in velocity towards the middle of the animation, slowing back down at the end.
