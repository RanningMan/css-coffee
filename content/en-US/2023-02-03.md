The hsl() functional notation expresses an sRGB color according to its hue, saturation, and lightness components. An optional alpha component represents the color's transparency.  
<br />  
hue value is an angle of the color wheel given in one of the following units: deg, rad, grad, and turn. By definition, red is 0deg, green is 120deg, and blue is 240deg. Other colors spread around the circle.  
<br />  
saturation value is a percentage where 100% is completely saturated and 0% is completely unsaturated (aka gray).  
<br />  
lightness value is a percentage where 100% is white, 0% is black, and 50% is "normal".  
<br />  
Note : The legacy hsla() syntax is an alias for hsl(), accepting the same parameters and behaving in the same way.
