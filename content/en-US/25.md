The animation-timing-function CSS property sets how an animation progresses through the duration of each cycle.  
There are multiple values can be applied to this property, today we will look at ease-in-out.  
A value of ease-in-out equals to cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 0.58, 1.0), with the animating properties slowly transitioning, speeding up, and then slowing down again.
