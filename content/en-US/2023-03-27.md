The animation-timing-function CSS property sets how an animation progresses through the duration of each cycle.  
There are multiple values can be applied to this property, today we will look at steps(n, < jumpterm >).  
steps function displays an animation iteration along n stops along the transition, displaying each stop for equal lengths of time. The second parameteer, jumpterm, defines how the animation connects between iterations.  
jump-start: The first jump happens when the animation begins;  
jump-end: The last jump happens when the animation ends;  
jump-none: There is no jump on either end. Instead, holding at both the 0% mark and the 100% mark, each for 1/n of the duration.  
jump-both: Includes pauses at both the 0% and 100% marks, effectively adding a step during the animation iteration.
