The animation-delay CSS property specifies the amount of time to wait from applying the animation to an element before beginning to perform the animation. The specified value can be positive or negative. A positive value indicates that the animation should begin after the specified amount of time has elapsed. A negative value causes the animation to begin immediately, but partway through its cycle.  
Note: The unit of the value is required. It is either seconds(s) or milliseconds(ms).
