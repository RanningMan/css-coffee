The animation-timing-function CSS property sets how an animation progresses through the duration of each cycle.  
There are multiple values can be applied to this property, today we will look at cubic-bezier().  
A cubic Bézier easing function is a type of easing function defined by four real numbers that specify the two control points, P1 and P2, of a cubic Bézier curve whose end points P0 and P3 are fixed at (0, 0) and (1, 1) respectively. The x coordinates of P1 and P2 are restricted to the range [0, 1].
