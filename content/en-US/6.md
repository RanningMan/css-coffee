The color-scheme CSS property allows an element to indicate which color schemes it can comfortably be rendered in.  
<br />  
Common choices for operating system color schemes are "light" and "dark", or "day mode" and "night mode". When a user selects one of these color schemes, the operating system makes adjustments to the user interface. This includes form controls, scrollbars, and the used values of CSS system colors.
