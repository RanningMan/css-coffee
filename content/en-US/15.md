The animation-direction CSS property sets whether an animation should play forward, backward, or alternate back and forth between playing the sequence forward and backward.  
Values:  
normal: The animation plays forwards each cycle.  
reverse: The animation plays backwards each cycle. Animation steps are performed backwards, and timing functions are also reversed. For example, an ease-in timing function becomes ease-out.  
alternate: The animation reverses direction each cycle, with the first iteration being played forwards. The count to determine if a cycle is even or odd starts at one.  
alternate-reverse: The animation reverses direction each cycle, with the first iteration being played backwards. The count to determine if a cycle is even or odd starts at one.
