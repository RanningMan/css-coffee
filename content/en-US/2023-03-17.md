The animation-fill-mode CSS property sets how a CSS animation applies styles to its target before and after its execution.  
Values:  
none: The animation will not apply any styles to the target when it's not executing.  
forwards: The target will retain the computed values set by the last keyframe encountered during execution.  
backwards: The animation will apply the values defined in the first relevant keyframe as soon as it is applied to the target, and retain this during the animation-delay period.  
both: The animation will follow the rules for both forwards and backwards, thus extending the animation properties in both directions.
