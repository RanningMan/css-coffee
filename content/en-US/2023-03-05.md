The hwb() functional notation expresses a given color according to its hue, whiteness, and blackness. An optional alpha component represents the color's transparency.  
<br />  
**hue (h)** value is an angle of the color wheel given in one of the following units: deg, rad, grad, and turn. By definition, red is 0deg, green is 120deg, and blue is 240deg. Other colors spread around the circle.  
<br />  
**whiteness (w)** specifies the amount of white to mix in, as a percentage from 0% (no whiteness) to 100% (full whiteness).  
<br />  
**blackness (b)** specifies the amount of black to mix in, as a percentage from 0% (no blackness) to 100% (full blackness).
